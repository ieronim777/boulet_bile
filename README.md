## Overview

PRISM Break is a software recommendation site that helps people to gain control
over their data.

If you want to work on the project, please review [docs][] and [code of conduct][].

## Principles

- **Privacy and security**

  We expect networking projects to follow [principle of least authority][], to
  be metadata-resistant, and to be [end-to-end encrypted][] with [forward
  secrecy][]. Modern crypto primitives, [memory safety][], and small, auditable
  implementations are major advantages.

  [forward secrecy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy
  [memory safety]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety

- **Free software**

  We expect projects to use an [FSF approved license][], or [one of our extras][].
  [Open core][] projects are discouraged.

  We might, in rare circumstances, recommend a source-available application
  (but never a binary blob), or a proprietary service, only if there are no
  pragmatic libre options. These projects have a pink `Non-free` label.

- **User experience**

  Ease of use, stability, and performance matter. Many of our readers are
  trying to regain control over their privacy for their first time. Let's make
  it a good experience for them.
