## Overview

## Glossary

**Target** is a family of devices that share capabilities and interfaces.
For example:

- *PC*

  [Personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer).
  Primary interfaces are a pointing device and a keyboard.

  Size does not matter. [GPD Pocket] is a PC, even though a tiny one, while
  [iPad Pro][] is a mobile device the size of a small laptop.

- *Mobile*

  Mobile device, includes phones and most tablets. Primary interface is touchscreen.

  [Surface Pro][] is not considered to be a mobile device at the moment,
  because its hardware is designed to be PC compatible.

  [Librem 5][] is a mobile device because it requires Wayland applications to be
  ported to support gestures and small screen sizes.

- *Servers*

  Hardware for continuously running end-user applications. Usually, the only
  interfaces are ports. The most common UI is SSH to a POSIX shell.

- *Routers*

  Hardware for pushing traffic on the network.
  
  Even though routers provide the same user interface as servers (remote access
  over HTTP/SSH), they differ in provided ports (routers have many RJ45 ports),
  computing architecture (more, but slower cores, little RAM and ROM) and
  sometimes hardware (AP-capable Wi-Fi card and antennae).

[Surface Pro]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_(2017)

**Operating system** is what people install on their *target* device that
provides it with basic functionality that other software builds upon. For
example: [Qubes OS][], [Replicant][], [OpenWrt][].

[Qubes OS]: https://www.qubes-os.org
[Replicant]: https://replicant.us
[OpenWrt]: https://openwrt.org

**Platform** is an intersection of *target* and *operating system*. For example,
`:pc/pureos` is [PureOS][] running on a personal computer, while `:mobile/pureos`
is PureOS running on Librem 5.

[PureOS]: https://pureos.net

**Application**

*Applications* have to be designed both with user's *target* device and
*operating system* in mind for optimal experience.

**Project** is an *application* or an *operating system*.

*Protocol*

### [L10n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)

String that should be translated. Both tracks strings that require translation
and retrieves translation when one is available.

If you want to help with translations, [go to Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/prism-break/).

Translation is retrieved from PO files. See [`res/po`](../res/po)
contents and [`prism-break.data.po`][] docs. Locales cascade, see
[`prism-break.tags.l10n`][] docs.

Tagged literal `#prism-break/l10n` takes a string and returns a translated string:

```clj
#prism-break/l10n "Secure-by-default XMPP server installer."
;; {:l10n :en} => "Secure-by-default XMPP server installer."
;; {:l10n :ru} => "Установщик безопасных по умолчанию XMPP-серверов."
```

Tagged literal `#prism-break/l10n+url` combines L10n and [URL](#url):

```clj
#prism-break/l10n+url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD"
;; {:l10n :en} => "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD"
;; {:l10n :zh-Hans} => "https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD"

#prism-break/l10n+url {:icann "https://www.debian.org"
                       :onion "http://sejnfjrq6szgca7v.onion"}
;; {:l10n :en :url :icann} => "https://www.debian.org" 
;; {:l10n :ru :url :onion} => "http://sejnfjrq6szgca7v.onion/index.ru.html"
;; {:l10n :tr :url :icann} => "https://debian.org/index.tr.html"
```

### Diff

Difference between two recursive flat sets of symbols, `:+` and `:-`:

```clj
{clearnet #prism-break/diff {:+ #{linux}
                             :- #{tails}} ;; => #{{:name "Debian"}}
 debian {:name "Debian"}
 linux #{debian tails}                    ;; => #{{:name "Debian"}
 tails {:name "Tails"}}                   ;;      {:name "Tails"}}
```
